- [X] Mariam: Improve the code integration.
- [X] Evelina: Implement features (Navigation pane).
- [X] Mohammed: Implement database.

#### 1.2 Goals:

 - [X] Implement the blog-oriented development of documents.
 - [ ] Improve the activity flow in the application(this will be carried over to the next week).

### __Section 2:__

 #### 2.1. What we did.
 During the last week, We gathered new requirements from the customer in respects to the advanced prototype as below:
 
- Add similar attributes in both Income and Expense layout.
- Add a toggle button to enable or disable the pin.
- Filters needs to be added in report summary (both in income and expense layouts).
- Add a library of icons for the category selection.
- Add an option to delete transactions.
- Add budget planning option (either category wise or monthly wise).
- Add a threshold on the amount of money that can be spent at maximum per month so as to receive a notification when the user is about to reach the limit and a different notification when the threshold is crossed.
- Overview of income and expenses (in the form of Pie charts / Bar Graphs).
- Addition of an option to be able to send an email with the complete summary of user's account(From - To (date option)).

#### 2.2 What worked:

- Got the Basic prototype presented & got the use case stories for the advanced prototype built(Ronald).
- Currently working on database integration with the application for the attributes and the layouts built till the basic prototype (Mohammed).
- Briefing about the basics of design pattern (Mariam).
- Started working on implementing the Navigational Pane for the application (Evelina).
- Collected all the basic requirements for the advanced prototype (Team).

#### 2.3 What we learned:

- Learned basics of SQLite DB and fundamentals in getting the DB integrated with the application.
- Started looking at different design patterns that could be implemented in the project.
- How to change the header for every layout of the application

#### 2.4 What trouble we had:

- Our knowledge on SQLlite was very limited.
- We did not know how to go about implementing the data base effectively and setup constraints for the attributes defined in different layouts like (Pin, Default categories etc.)

#### 2.5 Where we got stuck:

- We are still unaware of how to go about having a certain design pattern implemented for our application.

#### 2.6 Roles and responsibilities:

### __Section 3:__

#### 3.1 Plans:

- [ ] Start to work on fulfilling the advanced prototype requirements.
- [ ] Learn to import the library of icons for categories option.
- [ ] Investigate different design patterns that can be made use of .

### __Section 4:__

Agenda for the meeting with the TA.

Questions about project: (5 minutes)
- Present the use case stories developed (by Ronald) for the advanced prototype as per the requirements received and take the appropriate feedbacks
- Cross check with the Customer on how he needs the summary of both income and expense to be shared via email in specific (as a text file or pdf or excel)
