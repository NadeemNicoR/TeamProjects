 #### 2.1. What we did.
During the last week we got most of the changes in out application impletemented as we had planned in standup meeting and post receiving the customer's feedback on the advanced prototype built.
 
- Built the charts (both pie and barcharts) (3/4 th completed).
- We received the appropriate feedback from our customer on what needs to be changed and incase any additional requrements had to be added.
- We added the navigational pane that make the user easily access the application.
- We successfully got the toggle option added which will be presented to our customer this week.

#### 2.2 What worked:
- Standup meeting and additional task distribution.
- We came up with possible solutions for having income and expense activites merged into one so as to make the application interface look easier to access.
- we got the bar and pie chart implemented halfway through with addition of filter being one of the pending tasks.

#### 2.3 What we learned:
- How to specify conditions in coding so as to not accept blank values for different attributes of various activities in the application.
- A brief overview of white box and black box testing and how they can be used.

#### 2.4 What trouble we had:

- All the team members went through the general test process that we can implement and we are yet to decied on wheater to head forwared with white-box testing for 5 classes or black box testing with 5 user stories.

- We are still tyring to implement the notification popup or a stagnant message on the screen in case the user crosses the budget limit.

#### 2.5 Where we got stuck:

- Testing process to be implemented.
- Filter addition under the charts.
