Welcome to the final blog of team 405 Found - Money Control Application. We have approached the finish line. In this blog we will give you some reflections on our work as a team and a summary of what a Play Store Entry would be.

# Reflections


## Technical challenges our team encountered


In this project we worked together with people we never met before and who came from different backgrounds of engineering. For all of us it was a challenge and an adventure at the same time to develop an android application.

- Our previous experience with programming was not sufficient enough as to implement such a project of this importance. We faced difficulties in the beginning when trying to understand how android studio works. However our team had a very motivational spirit and together we encouraged each-other in learning more and with the time we became Android App developers.

- Beside programming in Java for the application, we had minor knowledge in building a Database and implementing it in Android Studio. After a lot of failures and testing, we managed to successfully implement and use the Database for our app thanks to our commitment and desire to improve.


## Challenges we experienced working as a team

Our team is made of four people with four different educational and professional backgrounds that were not at all related to computer science. Though this factor brought a great chance for us to learn to work in a diverse team, it also brought in some challenges with it.

- Since we came from four completely different cultures and backgrounds, we had in our team four different personalities. Everyone brought their own methods of approaching a problem and sometimes resulted in a conflict. To our luck, every member of our team behaved very professionally when these disagreements showed up. After all we were there for a common goal.

- Slight time and priority management was initially an issue we faced. Different members of our teams were taking different courses that took a lot of their time. We had to come across the schedule of everyone to find a proper time for the group meetings. After the initial two weeks we fixed a time slot for us to meet weekly and work on our app, that covered the lack we were facing in terms of completing the tasks assigned to each of us.

## Benefits of team work

- Our different nationalities influenced our way of thinking and this was reflected in our different approaches to solve the same problem which led our team to always finding good and interesting solutions.

- The fact that we were working within a team allowed us to learn faster from the experience of other teammates.

- Diversity in technical backgrounds was translated into a variety of strengths which in turn made us a better team.

- The fact that none of us had high programming skills increased the dose of complexity of the project, which sometimes was stressful for the team but we all learned together how to deal with such situations.

- We also learned that trust among teammates is important and how to give and take constructive criticism in order to give useful feedback to each other. 

- Regular meetings are important, to increase development speed of the team and also for reasons not related to the project as well. 


## What we learnt and what remains insufficient through the course of ISEE:

### Technical part:

### *What we Learnt:*

- To begin with, we all were beginners in Object Oriented Programming only being able to print "Hello World" with great difficulty!

- First and foremost, thanks to references and examples on [Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp). We were able to navigate ourselves through this journey of being able to learn how to program an android application using java to such an extent that we have successfully built an application on our own as a team.

- Secondly, we had very limited knowledge on handling repositories on GIT. Now we feel well versed with it as we had to deal with all  possible 'DON'T DO mistakes with GIT' which we ended up committing!


### *What we believe was inadequate:*

- We have cultivated most of the required OOP skills but we still believe there is much more to learn than what we have made use of in implementing the project.

- During the intial stages of our project we spent a lot of time learning about andriod studio, how it works and how to navigate through it. We believe if an overview on the usage of android studio given in the course would have had accelerated the process. 


### Organizational part:

### *What we Learnt:*

We were able to amplify some of the most significant Social and Team Management skills especially the below ones:

- Decision Making (coming up with different approaches to tackle the problem & deciding the best approach which would be more feasible and better to implement as a team).

- Problem Solving & Critical Thinking (especially while dealing with null pointer exception and debugging the errors on the app).

- Team work & empathy (assisting other team members when we were done with our assigned tasks).

- Taking the leadership initiatives (driving the team as a team leader when we had our individual presentations).


### *What we believe that we still need to improve:*

- Adhering to time strictly! (We could not get most of the tasks completed at an assigned time frame, most of the times we had the tasks fulfilled at the last minute of submissions).

- We as a team need to learn on how to divide the tasks equally among each other.

*Thank you for following us through this journey. We had a lot of fun coding and learned a lot of new things. We want to thank Dr. Sandro Schulze who gives students this opportunity to develop themselves in this area. It was a pleasure and you will hear from us in other projects for sure!*
