## Project

We developed an android application about Money Control, which objetive is to help the user to keep track and manage her/his finances. In order to do that, the application offers to the user different, but very specific features like; the budget, where the user can define a limit for her/his expenses; the transaction report, where a complete resume of transactions can be seen; and the Chart views, where the user can see a graphical representation of her/his transactions with especific filters in order to make the view even clearer.
